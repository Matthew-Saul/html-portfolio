<h1>The Best Films According to Matthew</h1>
<h2>Three Random Good Films</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Serious Man</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Cohen Brothers film. The content of this film seems the most personal to the 
    Choen brothers of any of their films I've seen thus far. As a result, the film feels like it has
    the most emotional depth to me. And is just really well done all around.</p>
<h3>Song Of The Sea</h3>
<p>A very unique style of animation and my favorite of the films by Cartoon Saloon. It's steeped in
    folklore, as all of their films have been so far, and it's a deeply beautiful and tender story.

<h3>Given</h3>
<p>A beautiful documentary about a family who takes a trip around the world, surfing, fishing, making 
    things with their hands, and telling stories steeped in meaning. The father in the family took 
    a similar trip with his father when he was very young. And he wanted his three year old son to 
    have a similar experience. The film is narrated by the three year old.
